## 🔧 Key Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed SSR Issues

The main issue was "window is not defined" error during server-side rendering. This was resolved by:

- Creating a custom `useLogo` hook that handles client-side theme detection
- Using `useEffect` for client-side-only operations
- Providing proper fallbacks for SSR

### 2. Enhanced Code Organization

- **Custom Hooks**: Created reusable hooks like `useLogo` for better code organization
- **Constants File**: Centralized all app constants for better maintainability
- **Utility Functions**: Common helper functions organized in `utils/helpers.js`
- **Enhanced API Service**: Improved API handling with retry logic and proper error handling

### 3. Better Error Handling

- **Error Boundary**: Component to catch and handle React errors gracefully
- **API Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling in API service
- **Loading States**: Loading components for better user experience

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **SSR-Compatible Components**: All components now work properly with SSR
- **Debounced Functions**: Utility functions for performance optimization
- **Proper Image Handling**: Optimized logo loading based on theme
