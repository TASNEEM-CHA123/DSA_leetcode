# User Analytics Implementation - Next.js Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of user analytics functionality in the Next.js app, migrated from the MERN stack architecture. The analytics system provides comprehensive insights into user performance, problem-solving patterns, and activity streaks.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Core Analytics Metrics

- **Current Streak**: Days of consecutive problem-solving activity
- **Longest Streak**: Maximum consecutive days achieved
- **Total Active Days**: Total number of days with submissions
- **Problems Solved**: Unique problems successfully completed
- **Total Submissions**: All submission attempts
- **Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of successful submissions

### 2. Advanced Analytics

- **Difficulty Distribution**: Breakdown by Easy/Medium/Hard problems
- **Language Statistics**: Programming languages used and frequency
- **Performance Insights**: Average attempts per problem, consistency metrics
- **Skill Level Assessment**: Automatic categorization (Beginner/Intermediate/Expert)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend API Routes

```
/api/users/[userId]/statistics - User problem-solving statistics
/api/users/[userId]/streak - Activity streak and calendar data
```

### Frontend Components

```
src/components/
├── UserAnalytics.jsx          # Basic analytics overview
├── AnalyticsDashboard.jsx     # Comprehensive analytics dashboard
├── ProfileStatistics.jsx     # Detailed statistics with charts
├── ProfileActivityStreak.jsx  # Activity heatmap and streak data
└── ActivityHeatmap.jsx        # GitHub-style activity calendar
```

### Custom Hooks

```
src/hooks/
└── useUserAnalytics.js        # Analytics data management with caching
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### 1. Data Collection

- Submissions are tracked in the database with timestamps
- Each submission includes: userId, problemId, status, language, createdAt
- Problems have difficulty levels and tags for categorization

### 2. Analytics Calculation

- **Statistics API**: Aggregates solved problems, calculates acceptance rates, groups by difficulty/language
- **Streak API**: Processes submission dates to calculate current/longest streaks and active days
- **Derived Metrics**: Frontend calculates additional insights from base data

### 3. Data Presentation

- Real-time analytics dashboard with interactive components
- GitHub-style activity heatmap showing daily activity
- Progress bars and visual indicators for key metrics
- Responsive design with smooth animations

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### API Integration

```javascript
// Statistics endpoint
GET /api/users/[userId]/statistics
Response: {
  totalSolved: number,
  totalSubmissions: number,
  solvedByDifficulty: { easy: number, medium: number, hard: number },
  solvedByLanguage: { [language]: number }
}

// Streak endpoint
GET /api/users/[userId]/streak?year=2024
Response: {
  currentStreak: number,
  longestStreak: number,
  totalActiveDays: number,
  activeDays: [{ date: string, count: number }]
}
```

### Custom Hook Usage

```javascript
const { statistics, streak, derivedMetrics, isLoading, refreshAnalytics } =
  useUserAnalytics(userId);
```

### Component Integration

```javascript
// Profile page with full analytics
<AnalyticsDashboard userId={user.id} />
<ProfileStatistics userId={user.id} />
<ProfileActivityStreak userId={user.id} />
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Design

- **Gradient Cards**: Color-coded metrics with smooth gradients
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars for goals and achievements
- **Activity Heatmap**: GitHub-style calendar showing daily activity
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Supports theme switching

### Interactive Elements

- **Refresh Button**: Manual data refresh with loading states
- **Year Selection**: Filter activity data by year
- **Hover Effects**: Detailed tooltips and hover states
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion animations for better UX

### Performance Optimizations

- **Data Caching**: 5-minute cache to reduce API calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed requests
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during data fetching

## 📈 Analytics Workflow

### 1. User Submits Code

```
User solves problem → Submission created → Database updated
```

### 2. Analytics Processing

```
Submission data → Statistics calculation → Streak calculation → Cache update
```

### 3. Dashboard Display

```
API fetch → Hook processing → Component rendering → User sees analytics
```

## 🔄 Migration from MERN

### Key Changes Made

1. **API Structure**: Migrated from Express routes to Next.js API routes
2. **Database Queries**: Adapted Drizzle ORM queries for PostgreSQL
3. **State Management**: Replaced Redux with custom hooks and React state
4. **Component Architecture**: Modernized with React 18 features
5. **Styling**: Updated to Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

### Backward Compatibility

- Maintained same API response formats
- Preserved existing component interfaces
- Kept familiar user experience patterns

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Analytics Display

```jsx
import { AnalyticsDashboard } from '@/components/AnalyticsDashboard';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile</h1>
      <AnalyticsDashboard userId={userId} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Custom Analytics Hook

```jsx
import { useUserAnalytics } from '@/hooks/useUserAnalytics';

function CustomAnalytics({ userId }) {
  const { statistics, derivedMetrics, refreshAnalytics } =
    useUserAnalytics(userId);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Problems Solved: {statistics?.totalSolved}</p>
      <p>Acceptance Rate: {derivedMetrics?.acceptanceRate}%</p>
      <button onClick={refreshAnalytics}>Refresh</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
