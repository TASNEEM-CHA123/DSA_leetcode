# Payment Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the DSATrek Razorpay payment system to ensure only successful payments result in subscription activations.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Payment Verification Flow

- **Mandatory Signature Verification**: All payments must pass Razorpay signature verification using HMAC SHA256
- **Order ID Validation**: Payment verification requires matching order ID from Razorpay
- **User Authentication**: Only authenticated users can initiate and verify payments

### 2. Subscription Activation Security

- **Payment-Only Activation**: Subscriptions can ONLY be activated through verified payments
- **Direct Subscription Endpoint Disabled**: The POST `/api/payments/subscription` endpoint is disabled to prevent unauthorized subscription updates
- **Valid Plan Validation**: Only valid paid plans (pro, premium, premium_monthly, premium_yearly) can be activated through payments

### 3. Error Handling Security

- **No Sensitive Information Exposure**: Error messages don't expose internal system details
- **Secure Logging**: Detailed error information is logged server-side only
- **Generic Error Messages**: Client receives generic error messages to prevent information disclosure

### 4. Audit Trail

- **Payment Logging**: All successful payment verifications are logged with:
  - User ID
  - Plan details
  - Razorpay order and payment IDs
  - Timestamps
  - Expiration dates
- **Failed Verification Logging**: Failed signature verifications are logged for security monitoring

## Payment Flow Security

### Step 1: Order Creation (`/api/payments/create-order`)

```
1. User authentication check
2. Plan validation
3. Razorpay order creation with secure notes
4. Return order details (no sensitive data exposed)
```

### Step 2: Payment Processing (Client-side Razorpay)

```
1. Razorpay SDK handles payment securely
2. Payment completion returns signature, order ID, and payment ID
3. Client sends verification data to server
```

### Step 3: Payment Verification (`/api/payments/verify`)

```
1. User authentication verification
2. Signature validation using Razorpay secret
3. Plan ID validation against allowed paid plans
4. Database update with subscription details
5. Audit logging
6. Return success response
```

## Security Validations

### Authentication

- NextAuth session validation on all payment endpoints
- User ID verification from authenticated session

### Payment Integrity

- HMAC SHA256 signature verification
- Order ID and payment ID validation
- Razorpay webhook signature verification (if implemented)

### Plan Validation

- Only valid paid plans can be activated
- Freemium plan cannot be "purchased"
- Plan expiry dates calculated server-side

### Database Security

- Parameterized queries using Drizzle ORM
- Atomic database updates
- Proper error handling for database operations

## Prevented Attack Vectors

### 1. Direct Subscription Manipulation

- **Attack**: Direct API calls to activate subscriptions without payment
- **Prevention**: Subscription POST endpoint disabled, only payment verification can activate subscriptions

### 2. Payment Bypass

- **Attack**: Fake payment verification attempts
- **Prevention**: Mandatory Razorpay signature verification using server-side secret

### 3. Information Disclosure

- **Attack**: Error message analysis to gain system information
- **Prevention**: Generic error messages, detailed logging server-side only

### 4. Plan Manipulation

- **Attack**: Attempting to activate invalid or free plans through payment
- **Prevention**: Server-side plan validation against whitelist

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Security Events Logged

- Failed signature verifications
- Invalid plan activation attempts
- Successful subscription activations
- Authentication failures on payment endpoints

### Recommended Monitoring

- Set up alerts for multiple failed payment verifications from same user
- Monitor for unusual payment patterns
- Track subscription activation rates vs payment success rates

## Environment Security

### Required Environment Variables

```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_secret_key (NEVER expose client-side)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_public_key_id (client-safe)
```

### Security Notes

- Razorpay secret key is never exposed to client
- All signature verification happens server-side
- Environment variables are properly secured

## Compliance

### Data Protection

- No sensitive payment data stored locally
- PCI DSS compliance through Razorpay
- User data encryption in transit and at rest

### Audit Requirements

- All payment transactions logged
- User consent tracked
- Subscription changes auditable

## Testing Security

### Security Test Cases

1. Attempt direct subscription activation without payment
2. Try payment verification with invalid signature
3. Test with invalid plan IDs
4. Verify error message security
5. Test authentication bypass attempts

### Recommended Security Testing

- Penetration testing of payment endpoints
- Signature verification testing with various payloads
- Authentication bypass testing
- Error handling security validation

## Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks

- Review payment logs for anomalies
- Update Razorpay SDK versions
- Monitor for new security vulnerabilities
- Review and update error handling

### Security Updates

- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor Razorpay security advisories
- Regular security code reviews
- Update authentication mechanisms as needed
